*** How to setup a Static IP address on Debian Linux ***

Objective

The objective is to configure a static IP address on Debian Linux server. 

Please note that for Desktop installations it is recommended to use GUI tools, such as network-manager. If you wish to configure your network interfaces directly via /etc/network/interfaces file on your Desktop, make sure you disable any other possibly interfering network configuration daemons. For example, the below commands will disable network-manager:

   # systemctl stop NetworkManager.service
   # systemctl disable NetworkManager.service

>> in /etc/network/interfaces :


# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet static
      address 192.168.1.44
      netmask 255.255.255.0
      gateway 192.168.1.1
      dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

>> To apply changes restart your network daemon:
# service networking restart
